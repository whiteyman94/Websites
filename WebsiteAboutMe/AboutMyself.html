	<hr />

	<p>My name is Carl White. I am 19 years old. I have a twin brother called Keith and an older sister called Michelle.
	I am currently attending the National universit of Ireland Maynooth. I am studying Computer Science and Software Engineering and am making 
	this website for a project for one of my modules. I am in second year at the university. The subject is waried which is very interesting 
	and the possibilities after completing the course are endless because computers are used in everything in the present day. My brother is doing
 	the same course as me in the same university as myself. Some people think this is amazing but we are twins who enjoy the same things and in today's
	attitude towards computers it was inevitably we were gonna do the same course but the university we chose was just by chance the best course for what
	we wanted to do. I enjoy computer games very much and have just bought the PS4 with its new next gen Radeon graphics card and even built my own gaming pc 
	which i use daily of course. I also would like to learn to make computer games for a living but am undecided if i like 2d or 3d gaming better. I hope 
	to get an internship in a games company next year in collge so i can see the work that goes into the building and designing of a game so i can make up my
	mind on what to do for the rest of my life. I have the obssession of programming ever since i started doing stuff on my own and hope to continue to 
	do this for the rest of my life. My other passion is watching movies. I find movies so amazing and the symbolism the director can protray to the audience
	I'd watch at least one new movie a week and look forward the changing comic book movie trend that is sweeping Hollywood and the puvlic over the past few years.
	i just like being intranced and engrossed in the character and feeling what they feel and i especially like the sci-fi movies because the scenary and the reactions
	of the people in the films are just amzing and i hope that I can see space just once in my life time.
