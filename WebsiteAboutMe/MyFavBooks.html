	<hr />

	<p>My favourite books are the Lord of the Rings trilogy books. They were created by J.K. Tolkien around 1940. They 
	describe this land of Middle-Earth adn all the fantasy elements combined. Not many people know this series of books are actually a sequel 
	to the Hobbit book which starts the quest of the ring. The ring is the absolute power in the world. He who weilds it can rule the world. 
	It was held by the dark lord Sauron who ruled over the dark force called the orcs. Theres orcs are hideous creatures who only fight for fun. 
	But before the tale of the books there was a war between sauron and the forces of men allied with the elves. They defeated Sauron and the humans 
	kept the ring for their own gain. But they didnt't know how to use the power and edventually it was lost. This begins our tale as a humble hobbit 
	holds the rings many years later. A wizard named Gandalf finds this out and forces the hobbit to take to ring to Rivendall, the last known capital
 	to the elves. Here the hobbits join a fellowship to take the ring to Mordor which is an active volcanoe in the heart of the enemies terrotory and 
	only in its fire can the volcanoe, Mount Doom. They venture off into the unknown with an elf, a dwarve, a ranger, a prince and a wizard. Soon the fellowship encounter the forces of evil and the news of the ring reaches the dark lord sauron. The story expands as the hobbits split up with the fellow and go their own way. This leads both groups into different wars and different enemys. The Two towers , the second book, leads to a huge battle, the first of three main battles for the forces of men to face the orcs of the dark lord. The forces of men win only by the wizards power to change peoples minds. The hobbits run into a creature called gollum who leads them into the dark land of Mordor. As the climax unfolds the third book , The return of the king reveils the ranger to be a long lost heir to the ruler of man. The hobbits reach the end of their journey battling their inner demons and the creature gollum and the forces of men defeat the forces of mordor and restore good to the men and woman of the world of Mi	ddle-Earth. The epic fantasy and action style of writing is why I really enjoy these books and why I would recommend these books to anyone who enjoys fantasy action films.
