	<aside class="first">Hi im Carl White and this is my first try at creating my own website. 
	This introduction to my webpage is just to tell the user what i hope to achieve with my website and how well the user accessibility is and to tell the user a little 
	bit about myself and what u can expect to see on the other webpages.I am very interesting computers and the use of html and css is completely different to the object orientated languege I was use to using. 
	The use of html is a different way to programming then the programming language Java that i was using before. 
	The pictures I have chosen to use are to show my use of css within html. With this webage based project I hope to achieve a better understanding of the 
	html and css language. This is my first attempt at the making of a full homepage. As u can see it will allow the user to click the links to the left 
	which include my favourite games and about myself and stuff like that, They will give the user a look at myself 
	what I enjoy to do and watch . This project is my first web designing project that is available online and the accessibility between webpages is showing my 
	undertsanding of the html basics and the design of my several different webpages will show my undertstanding of css and html combined . By the end of this webpage project 
	I should be able to do these basic html and css programming and to be able to create a basic to average working website that will incorporate the use of javascript and css.
 	This webpage assignment will help me in my later endevours into the world of web designing and any group projects that may take place while i am still
 	attending college. I hope to be able to write html programming off the top of my head just like the jave programming language and understand what to look for 
	when my code does not do what it should do and how to get it to do what i want it to accomplish.
