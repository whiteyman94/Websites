	<p>My favourite comic book hero would have to be the dark crusader vigilante Batman. He was created
	back in the 1940's and back then was less harsh and brutal than now. He would have just been alot of help the police without
	the fear and pain the character brought in the later years. His costume wasn't armored at all and was just really a disguise 
	.In the later dipictions of the caped crusader we see a normal man trying to take back his city. Gotham city where he was born and raised
	is where all the criminals stayed and ruled over the city corrupting anyone who they needed and killing anyone who they didnt.
	The man behind the mask , Bruce Wayne, is the heir to the wayne enterprises fortune. His parents were murdered in his young age 
	and he was raised by his butler Alfred. Thie child was troubled by the villainy in the town and at a later age he left the city 
	to become the greatest martial arts student. He was recruited in the league of shadows and quickly moved up the ranks. But when he learned
	of the leagues ways of murder and sacrifice to purge the world he destroyed them. When he returned to the city of Gotham the gunman who
	had murdered his parents was released. Bruce wanted real justice to be done in the city and so began to explore his fears to make 
	them his strengths. He found this in bats a the were his only fear in the world. He adapted the bats way of the dark and became the 
	batman with the help of his under cover research lab in the Wayne enterprises building. His suit was now armored and aerodynamic and could even glide.
 	This is my favourite comic book hero because he is now brutal to the criminals but his moral code dictates he kill no one. Later when the comic
	bokks linked with other comic books batman stood tall , even with no super powers he was still a hero to be reckened with and this is why he is my
	favourite comic book hero, even with no super powers he is the greatest hero in my opinion.
