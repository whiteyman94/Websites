	<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468569/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">The dark knight on IMDB</a>
	
	<p >This webpage is going to deal with a couple of my favourite movies which include the Dark Knight , Man of Steel and Avengers Assemble.
	First as u can see I am interested in comic book heroes and this shows in my choice of favourite movies. The dark knight has to be my top movie pick for anyone
	who enjoys a trilling and interesting movie with alot of action and drama. Heath ledger plays the villian named the joker and he is a sociopathe who's only plan
	is to show people's true instincts as he creates mass panic and chaos. The mask vigilante called the Batman is played by the academy award winning actor Christian
	Bale. He trys to stop the joker, a criminal who's so unpredictable and insane that it pushes him to invade the city's privacy to track down and hunt this devious
	villain.My favourite quote from this movie is from the joker where he rants about himself 

		<blockquote>Wanna know how I got these scars? My father, was a drinker...and a fiend. And one night, he goes off craaaazier than usual. Mommy gets the kitchen to defend herself. He doesnt like that. Not...one...bit. So, me watching, he takes the knife to her, laughing while he does it. He turns to me, and he says, "Why so serious?". Comes at me with the knife, "Why so serious?!". Sticks the blade in my mouth, "Let's put a smile on that face." Aaaand, why so serious?<cite>Content taken from wikipedia</cite></blockquote>

	<a href="http://www.manofsteel.com/index.html">Man Of Steel</a>

	<p>The second movie , Man of Steel, is another adaptation of the comic book superman. It takes a more personal approach to the super hero showing his flaws and inner demons, not just his his immmense super strength and flight. I thought this was an interesting an epic film for the spectacular opening sequence which opens to a civil
	war on an alien planet and the end battle scene where superman had to kill for the first time in his life to save the people of earth. He will have to live with this 
	decision for the rest of his life and this will show when the sequel will be released.

	<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0848228/?ref_=nv_sr_2">The Avengers on IMDB</a>
	
	<p>The last film , Avengers Assemble, is about a mix match group of super heroes brought together 
	to save the world from an alien force originating from the other side of the galaxy. This was just a truly incredible film because of the amount of heroes in this 
	film which has never been done before in film history. This film had iron man, who was a man who had a shrapnel in  his blood stream which would kill him without the suit, then theres 
	the hulk, who was a man who when he got angry would turn into a huge green rage monster, then theres thor , a norse god who had a hammer forge in the heart of a dying star
	and the ability to control lightening and then captain americ who was frozen in a block of ice in 1945 and revived in the present day , this character has super strength and
	a shield that is indestructable.
