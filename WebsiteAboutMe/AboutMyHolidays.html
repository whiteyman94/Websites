	<p>I've only been on two holidays in my life, one trip to Portugal and one trip to Las Vegas. I went to
	Portugal back when I was 12. It was scary when I had to go on a plane for the first time. This was all new to me and quiet frightening 
	because it is a huge flying tube to me. But will up in the air i was fine. The sun all around a see of clouds. I could even see the curviture of the earth. It was amazing. In Portugal I did the typical holiday things, stay in the pool all day and go to the town at night. The town lit up in the evening and didnt stop till 4 in the morning. The weather was so hot, like nothing i had experienced before because of the Irish climate. The food was basically
	the same and this was the first time i actually heared people s[eaking in a different language apart from Irish. My second other holiday to Las Vegas
	was when I was 18. This I was really excited for because i have never been to America before. The second we could see the city of Las Vegas i realise everything here is bigger and better. The airport was huge compared to ireland and the people in security were so much more strict but that was expected. 
	We were on the 42 floor of an enormous hotel which was built on top of a casino. This was truly a different world than I live in. I was only 18 so i couldnt enjoy the casino but i explored all the sites. The strip took two trys to complete because of just the dead heat outside and the length of the strip. Out in the mojave desert the roads were long and straight and the views were breath taking. There was huge cliffs and everything was sun dried with the desert floor being dust and so orange. I imagined this was what Mars would look like. We had to have the air conditiioning on in the car and the 
	windows up all the time because the heat was just to unbearable to us Irish. America is a huge country and even though I just explored the state of Nevada, I already want to go back again to see more of the country. The people were pleasant to talk to and whenever I said I was Isish they instantly 
	wanted to know more about Ireland. This trip to Las vegas is my havourite holiday ever for I will never experience this new change of culture again.
